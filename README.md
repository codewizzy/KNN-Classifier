# KNN-Classifier

1. K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique.
2. K-NN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories.
3. K-NN algorithm stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suite category by using K- NN algorithm.

I have implemented KNN algorith to classify 
##### the tuple:X = {age = “<= 30”, income = “medium”, student = “yes”, credit rating = “fair”}
using the neighbours points from dataSheet for classfication
